# Cardiovascular-disease-prediction-using-bioinformatics-approach

## Abstract:
Usually a heart attack occurs when the flow of blood to the heart is severely reduced or blocked. A heart attack is also called a myocardial infarction. The various cardiovascular conditions such as Congestive heart failure (CHF), ischemic heart diseases (IHD), diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), acute coronary syndromes (ACS), and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Prompt treatment is needed for a heart attack to prevent death. 17.9 million People die each year from CVDs, an estimated 32% of all deaths worldwide by WHO. 

In current clinical practice, diagnostic tools such as electrocardiography, echocardiography, and radio diagnostics are used. But the above mentioned techniques major limitations are it is of high cost and more time consuming process. So by using bioinformatics, one can overcome the limitations. Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data, in particular when the data sets are large and complex. Bioinformatics plays a key role in the biomarker discovery process, bridging the gap between initial discovery phases such as experimental design, clinical study execution, and bio analytics, including sample preparation, separation and high-throughput profiling and independent validation of identified candidate biomarkers. 

In Vivo and In Vito takes more time and work for identifying the Cardiovascular Diseases. In this epics project we are going to use In Silico techniques such as Bioinformatics and Machine Learning Techniques to identify the Cardiovascular Diseases. Here we would identify the proteins and genes responsible for Cardiovascular Diseases and then develop the framework to identify the disease in advance and by this we can save many lives.
